What is Vue.js?
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It's known for its ease of use, reactivity system, and flexibility in creating single-page applications (SPAs). The key feature of Vue is its reactivity system, which allows the UI to update automatically when the underlying data changes.
