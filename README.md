**What is Vue.js?**

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It's known for its ease of use, reactivity system, and flexibility in creating single-page applications (SPAs). The key feature of Vue is its reactivity system, which allows the UI to update automatically when the underlying data changes.

**Vue's Reactivity System Example**

Real-Life Example: The "Smart Mirror"
Imagine you have a smart mirror that displays information like the time, weather, and news. Every time there is an update in the data (like a weather change), the mirror automatically updates the display without you needing to press a button.

In Vue, the data you want to display is like the weather information, and the template is like the mirror screen. Whenever the data changes, the template automatically updates.
